# TicTacToe
General Information:
This Tic Tac Toe game was the first game I exercise I completed in Pygame.

Instructions:
Using the mouse, click on a square to make a move. An X or O will be highlighted in red in the bottom left corner of the screen to indicate whose turn it is. Once a square has been taken, the other player may not select that square. Once someone wins the game, no more squares can be selected. The outcome of the game will be displayed at the top of the screen.

To Reset the Game:
press Spacebar
